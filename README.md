# StackedPirates
Stacks Pirates is a terminal based (eventually a visual 2d game) roguelike - deck building - boss fighting - pirate themed game.
In this game you equip cards to yourself, your crew, and your ship to travel the world fighting enemies, kill mini bosses, and eventually tracking down and kill the Kraken. 
very much a WIP.
